# 128 Subscribers! Thank You!

This is the BASIC program for the Commodore 128 used in our 128 Subscriber Special Thank You video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZl4tio-9Tg

Please check out our youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/CityXen

There are two programs on the disk 128-thankyou.d64

3 "THANKYOU" PRG

3 "BINARYCOUNT" PRG

THANKYOU.PRG is the program that plays the ZZTop Thank You music.

BINARYCOUNT.PRG is the program the counts from 0 to 128 in binary and is overlayed onto the video.

Again, Thank You all!
